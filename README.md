Style-Doc is Black for Python docstrings and reStructuredText (rst). It can be used to format
docstrings ([Google docstring format](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings))
in Python files or [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

Style-Doc can handle Linux, Windows and Mac style line endings. The output will nevertheless be convertet to `\n` Linux line endings.
